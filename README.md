To use this you will need:

Once these have been installed clone the repo, `cd` into the directory, and start the provision by running:

```

Now, install the dependencies with:

npm install && bower install
```

Once that's done run either the `grunt build` or `grunt deploy` task below to generate the assets for the theme.


### Database

To create the database navigate to [http://localhost:4567/phpmyadmin](http://localhost:4567/phpmyadmin) and log in with the username "root" and the password of "vagrant". Once you've added a new database for the Wordpress instance to use, remember to copy these setting over to the `site/wp-content/wp-config.php` file.

Now navigate to [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) to begin the Wordpress installation.


### Building assets

From the root of the repository run the grunt watch task to automatically compile the Sass and lint the JS when you make changes:

```shell
grunt watch
```

#### Available tasks

There are 4 build tasks included in the Gruntfile:

```shell
grunt (test|build|deploy)
```

1. test: lints the JS
2. build: compiles CSS and JS, and copies the images and fonts to the assets directory of the theme
3. deploy: runs the build task then minifies the CSS and JS
4. default: runs the test and then build tasks


To Do
